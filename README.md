## Project Description

Main goal of this project is to analyse speeches from world leaders of democratic and autocratic countries, with the data gathered through web-scraping techniques.
Some methods of analysis are replicated from the paper "Comparing public communication in democracies and autocracies: automated text analyses of speeches by heads of government" (Maerz & Schneider, 2019)
The folder web_scraping contains some of the codes used to web scrape speeches from different governements' websites.
The folder dict_analysis contains the methods of analysis as done in Maerz & Carsten, which includes dictionary analysis and validity checking. Additional analysis is done with a dataset of reddit comments, for further validity checking
The folder llm_analysis contains the analysis of the speeches, but this time done with Hugging Face Mistral model.
